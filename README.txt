Welcome to the Parallel Game of Life Repository

Conway's Game of LÃ­fe was implemented in C++ and parallelizaed using MPI. The code is located in Life.cpp, with Life.h the header file and main.cpp the main file. Results
of some high performance computing experiments can be found in Report.pdf.

The main computation is executed with the C++ code. Post processing was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
